FDA COA Division Guidance 3 & 4 Analysis


## Installation

You can install the released version of  `COA34` from github using the `devtools` R package. Note that you may need to install `Rtools40` on your machine. I have found that the instructions available here to be straightforward: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. 

After installing `Rtools40`, do the following to install `COA34` from github:


``` r
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("CJangelo/COA34")
```
This package probability won't be released to CRAN, but this github repository will be updated due to how frequently me and my team use these functions. 


## Example

For concise examples of how the functions can help your workflow, see the Introductory Vignette (https://cjangelo.github.io/COA34/articles/introduction.html) under `Articles` at the top of this page.
