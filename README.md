Psychometric analyses aligned with FDA COA Division Guidance 3 & 4.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `COA34` from github using the
`devtools` R package. Note that you may need to install `Rtools40` on
your machine. I have found that the instructions available here to be
straightforward: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

After installing `Rtools40`, do the following to install `COA34` from
github:

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("CJangelo/COA34")
```

This package probability wonâ€™t be released to CRAN, but this github
repository will be updated due to how frequently me and my team use
these functions.

## Example

For concise examples of how the functions can help your workflow, see
the `Articles` at the top of this page.
