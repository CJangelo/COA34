CHANGE LOG (BUGS AND OTHER ALTERATIONS)


date: 7.6.21
function: compute_iccA1
change: added this function due to FDA feedback 

function: compute_ecdf
change: updated it to handle missing data


date: 4.30
function: "compute_anchor_delta"
function: "compute_change_score"
change: in the merge function, using "all = T" rather than "all.x = T"
reason: we want to keep all subject IDs
THIS DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM - still need to ensure you have all subjects at all timepoints
Enter NA yourself when doing data management
Test this
